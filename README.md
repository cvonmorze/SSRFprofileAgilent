# SSRFprofileAgilent

This package consists of a custom pulse sequence for efficiently measuring the spatial and spectral profiles of spectral-spatial radiofrequency (SSRF) excitation
pulses on a Agilent MRI scanner ('profile1d_test.c'). Package also includes flyback SSRF waveforms for selective excitation of [1-13C]pyruvate and [1-13C]lactate
(at the same slice location) at 4.7T.
