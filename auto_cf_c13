// auto_cf_c13
//
// Automatically sets the C13 center frequency to the location of the largest resonance
// To use, have a slab spectrum sequence and an EPI set up in the study queue 
// Then select the slab sequence and type the following in the command window:
// go shell('sleep 1.1') auto_cf_c13 shell('sleep 1.0') acquire
// This will start the slab sequence, run the macro, and then start the EPI sequence
//
// Other tips:
// The EPI must be above the spectrum in the queue
// The sleep times can be adjusted, but make sure that the macro does not start before
// the first sequence is complete
// Because of the xmnext command, you will not see the 1D spectrum on screen
// C13offset should be reset to initial value if running the script more than once
